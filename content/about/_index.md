I'm an interweb enthusiast from Indonesia. I was born, raised, and probably drinking too much sun in the country of sixteen thousand islands, Indonesia.
‚Äç

I love trees and typography. Although generally a calm presence in life, I'm notoriously brutal in Mario Kart and Pingpong.

I write about product development, teamwork in an emerging tech company, and scaling profitable service business. The opinions I share here are entirely my own and do not reflect those of the company that employs me.

While you would find some English here and there, I try my best to write all the articles in Bahasa.
