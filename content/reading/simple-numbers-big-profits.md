title: "Simple Number, Straight Talk, Big Profits"
description: "Value profitability over tax savings. Stop distorting your net income because of improper owner compensation. Use market-based wages for everyone in the business, including shareholders. Pay back your investors before you share profits, and create reasonable financial expectations for your investors. Consider working in a limited capacity at a lower wage as you transition out of active management."
