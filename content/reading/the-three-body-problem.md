title: The Three-Body Problem
description: "“What do you think the enemy is afraid of?” “You! Scientists! The odd thing is that the less practical your research is, the more they’re afraid of you—like abstract theories, the kind of thing Yang Dong worked on. They are more frightened of such work than you are of the universe winking at you. When a scientist dies, another will take his place. But if his thoughts are confused, then science is over.”"
