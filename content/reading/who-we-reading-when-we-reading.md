title: "Who We're Reading When We're Reading Murakami"
description: "He says, “A Wild Sheep Chase, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle were each important stepping stones, but with the first two I was still unable to write as well as I thought I was capable of. With The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle I felt that I did everything I could, so it’s central to my body of work. If I may say so myself, I think that it’s a well-written book.”"
