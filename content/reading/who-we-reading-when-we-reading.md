title: "Who We're Reading When We're Reading Murakami"
description: "“Birnbaum and Luke both believed in the importance of—to borrow the phrase Jay Rubin uses in his book about Murakami—the “music of words.” But they didn’t always see or hear things the same way. They listened to different music, read different authors, and had lived in different parts of the world.”"
