## Narrative

Pak Andi owns a small toko kain in Bandung, serving a loyal customer base looking for the latest in modest fashion. Traditionally, when a customer asks how a fabric will look as a gamis or koko shirt, Pak Andi must rely on imagination or time-consuming manual sketches. This often leads to indecision and lost sales.

With MotifAI, Pak Andi simply snaps a photo of any fabric in his shop. Within seconds, he can show his customer a realistic mockup of that fabric as a gamis, tunic, or even a men’s shirt. The customer is delighted to see exactly how the fabric will look, making it easier to choose and buy on the spot. When the sale is made, Pak Andi records the order and updates his inventory directly within the app, saving time and reducing errors.

The app’s subscription model is affordable and easy to manage, and Pak Andi appreciates the Bahasa Indonesia interface and mobile-friendly design. As word spreads, more customers visit his shop for the modern, interactive experience. Pak Andi’s sales increase, his workflow is smoother, and his business stands out in a competitive market.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

* AI model for fabric-to-mockup image generation (cloud-based inference)

* Flutter-based cross-platform codebase for native Android/iOS apps and PWA

* Secure back-end for user management, image storage, and payment processing

* Native business operations management (inventory, orders, sales) within the platform

* Payment gateway integration (local Indonesian providers preferred)

* **Multi-language support:** Bahasa Indonesia and English

### Integration Points

* Payment gateway (e.g., Midtrans, Xendit)

* Optional: WhatsApp or social sharing APIs

### Data Storage & Privacy

* Secure cloud storage for user-uploaded images and generated mockups

* Compliance with Indonesian data privacy regulations (PDP Law)

* User authentication and access control

* Data retention and deletion policies

### Scalability & Performance

* Designed for 1,000+ concurrent users at launch

* AI inference optimized for low-latency responses

* Scalable storage and compute resources

### Technical Risks & Boundaries

* **Emphasis:** Only fabric-to-mockup on pre-shot models is in scope for MVP. User try-on, sketch-to-pattern, and CAD-to-garment are explicitly out of scope for MVP and will be considered in future phases.

* **AI Cost Management:** For MVP, leverage existing third-party AI APIs/models. For future scalability, evaluate the cost/benefit of building or fine-tuning in-house models.

* **Mockup/Vector Asset Sourcing:** Mahesh (Munu) will provide a database of garment mockups/vectors, with the option for the design team to supplement as needed.

* **UI Simplicity:** The UI must be simple, fast, and user-friendly, with minimal friction and no unnecessary complexity.

### Potential Challenges

* Ensuring high-quality, realistic mockups for diverse fabric types

* Handling poor image uploads (blurry, low-light, etc.)

* Reliable business operations management and error handling

* Payment failures and subscription management

* Supporting low-bandwidth users

* Managing third-party AI API costs as usage scales
